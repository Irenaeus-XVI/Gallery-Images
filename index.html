            <td style="background-color: #223;">As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with th
                study of celestial bodies by applying the laws of
                physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of
                different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular
                physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book
                unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics,
                which will be crucial for the holistic understanding
                of the subject matter.

            <td style="background-color: #223;">Are we alone in the Universe? Was there anything
                before the Big Bang? Are there other universes?
                What makes stars shine? Where does Earth's water
                come from? Why is the night sky dark? Was there
                ever life on Mars? How do telescopes work? This
                engaging guide book answers all these questions
                and hundreds more.

            <td style="background-color: #223;">This second edition of Introduction to Cosmology
                is an exciting update of an award-winning
                textbook. It explains modern cosmological
                concepts, such as dark energy, in the context of the
                Big Bang theory. Its clear, lucid writing style, with
                a wealth of useful everyday analogies, makes it
                exceptionally engaging.

                multidisciplinary endeavor with efforts coming
                from engineering and natural sciences. This book
                provides an up-to-date interdisciplinary geoscience-
                focused overview of solid solar system bodies and
                their evolution, based on the comparative
                of processes acting on them.
